🔥 Auto-Tune Plugin (v1.0.0) – Full Documentation 🔥  

📌 Overview  
The Auto-Tune plugin dynamically adjusts Pwnagotchi’s behavior based on real-time performance metrics, optimizing WPA handshake collection and reducing unnecessary scanning. This helps balance power efficiency and attack effectiveness.  

✅ Adjusts Pwnagotchi’s attack intensity dynamically  
✅ Tunes AI parameters based on environmental conditions  
✅ Reduces unnecessary deauth packets to avoid detection  
✅ Improves battery life by lowering scanning intensity when needed

⚙️ How It Works  
Auto-Tune continuously monitors real-time Wi-Fi conditions and adjusts Pwnagotchi’s behavior accordingly.  

It considers factors like:  
✅ Signal Strength (RSSI): Adjusts attack intensity based on distance  
✅ Battery Levels: Lowers attack rate when battery is low  
✅ AI Learning Metrics: Dynamically tunes behavior for better handshake capture  

Example: If Pwnagotchi detects a dense Wi-Fi environment, Auto-Tune lowers deauthentication intensity to avoid suspicion.

🛠️ Installation & Setup  
This plugin comes pre-installed, but you need to enable it.  

1️⃣ Enable the Plugin  
Edit your Pwnagotchi config file:  

	sudo nano /etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml  

Find (or add) the Auto-Tune section:  

	[main.plugins.auto-tune]
	enabled = true
	aggression = 2  # 1 = Low, 2 = Normal, 3 = High
	adapt_power = true  # Reduce scanning intensity when battery is low  

📌 Explanation of Config Options:  
- `enabled`: `true` to activate Auto-Tune  
- `aggression`: Controls deauthentication intensity  
  - `1` = Low (Stealth mode, minimal interference)  
  - `2` = Normal (Balanced attack & stealth)  
  - `3` = High (Aggressive deauthing, drains battery faster)  
- `adapt_power`: If `true`, Pwnagotchi lowers attack rate when on battery  

2️⃣ Restart Pwnagotchi to Apply Changes  

	sudo systemctl restart pwnagotchi

🛠️ Advanced Configuration  
For fine-tuning performance, use these additional options:  

	[main.plugins.auto-tune]
	min_rssi = -75  # Minimum signal strength before targeting a network
	max_clients = 10  # Maximum clients to deauth per AP
	max_attempts = 3  # Stop trying after 3 failed deauth attempts  

📌 What These Do:  
- `min_rssi`: Ignores networks with weak signals (avoids wasted scans)  
- `max_clients`: Limits how many clients are targeted per AP  
- `max_attempts`: Stops retrying after too many failed handshake captures

🚀 Best Practices & Optimization  

🔥 Increase Aggression in Dense Areas:  
If you're in a Wi-Fi-heavy location (airports, cafés), increase aggression:  

	aggression = 3  

This maximizes handshake collection but increases detection risk.  

🔥 Use Low Aggression for Stealth Mode:  
For low-profile sniffing, use:  

	aggression = 1  
	adapt_power = true  

This reduces your Wi-Fi footprint, making Pwnagotchi less detectable.  

🔥 Combine with Grid Plugin for AI-Based Tuning:  
Use the Grid plugin to allow AI-driven tuning for Auto-Tune.  

---

🛠️ Debugging & Logs  
To check if Auto-Tune is working, run:  

	tail -f /var/log/pwnagotchi.log | grep auto-tune  

If the plugin isn’t behaving as expected, restart Pwnagotchi:  

	sudo systemctl restart pwnagotchi

🔥 Final Thoughts  
The Auto-Tune plugin makes Pwnagotchi smarter by dynamically adapting attack intensity and power usage based on real-world conditions. If you want maximum efficiency with minimal effort, this plugin is a must-have.
